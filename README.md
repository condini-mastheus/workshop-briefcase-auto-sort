# Briefcase Auto Sort

This workshop project explores the algorithmic complexities of creating briefcase auto sort algorithm.

For example, imagine we have a 3x3 inventory. Consider 0 a empty slot and 1 already used slot:

```
// inventory
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
```

Supose we pickuped 2 itens, one is 2x1 and other 1x1. We end up with something like this

```
// inventory
1, 1, 0
1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
```

Now we pickuped another item with 2x3 dimentions, but we can't add to our inventory because it won't fit.

```
// inventory
1, 1, 0
1, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
```

So the goal of this tool is to check if can rearrange our current inventory disposition of elements to save up space and fit as many itens we can.

```
// inventory
1, 1, 1
0, 0, 0
0, 0, 0
```
